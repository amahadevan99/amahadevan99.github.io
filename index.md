The self avoiding walk is perhaps the simplest nontrivial model of a polymer in a solvent, but its mathematical properties are still not fully understood. Here we discuss a mapping between the self avoiding walk and a model of a magnet composed of n-component interacting spins where n is set to 0. This mapping allows to estimate scaling exponents of the self avoiding walk that amazingly agree with experiment.

We develop the framework to perform gaussian integrals in the limit of an infinite number of random variables, which is essential for doing field theory. Using this machinery, we explore the Hohenberg-Wagner-Mermin theorem, which states that systems with a continuous symmetry cannot spontaneously order at low temperatures.

How can we understand observed irregular patterns of electrical activity in the brain via analysis of toy models? Here we look at two classes of models that have been studied in this context, and provide a rough outline of the statistical physics-motivated methods of analyzing them.

<a href="https://amahadevan99.github.io/files/marchenko_pastur.pdf"> The cavity method in random matrix theory [PDF].</a>
The cavity method is an obscure name for asserting consistency between the statistical properties of large (particularly disorded) systems. Here we apply it to the theory of random matrices to calculate the eigenvalue distribution of two famous matrix ensembles.

A brief introduction to the ubiquitous PCA (principal component analysis) and its close relative the SVD (singular value decomposition). We present a toy application of PCA in the processing of electrophysiological data from _in silico_ neurons.

<a href="https://amahadevan99.github.io/files/fpt_notes.pdf"> When does a random walker in one dimension first return to the origin? Here we calculate the distribution of first passage times for a biased and unbiased random walker, and find that the mean first passage time diverges in the unbiased case!
