How can we understand observed irregular patterns of electrical activity in the brain via analysis of toy models? Here we look at two classes of models that have been studied in this context, and provide a rough outline of the statistical physics-motivated methods of analyzing them.

The cavity method is an obscure name for asserting consistency between the statistical properties of large (particularly disorded) systems. Here we apply it to the theory of random matrices to calculate the eigenvalue distribution of two famous matrix ensembles.

A brief introduction to the ubiquitous PCA (principal component analysis) and its close relative the SVD (singular value decomposition). We present a toy application of PCA in the processing of electrophysiological data from _in silico_ neurons.
