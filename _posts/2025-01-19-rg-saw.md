Random walks constitute stochastic processes where the position of a walker at a given time $$T$$ is the sum of a number $$N$$ of random variables where $$N$$ inreases proportional to $$T$$. These random walkers are permitted to visit the same location multiple times. Here we will consider a model of a _self avoiding_ walk which is similar to a random walk in some ways, but crucially different in others.  The physical motivation comes from long string-like objects: polymers are a good example, DNA being perhaps the most famous. The essential question we will try to answer is how the distance between the ends of a polymer chain of length $$L$$ scales with $$L$$, averaged over all configurations of the polymer chain which do not involve self-crossings. See [here](https://amahadevan99.github.io/files/saw_jc_notes.pdf) for some more notes on the self-avoiding walk, and a discussion of how this problem is related to critical phenomena in models of magnets. In this post we will explore a different (and more transparent) route to understanding the self avoiding walk, and will in fact be able to estimate the scaling of the linear size of the polymer chain with $$L$$ by means of a renormalization group argument similar to the one discussed for percolation [here](https://amahadevan99.github.io/2024/05/27/percolation.html).

The argument we will discuss is from the book _Introduction to Renormalization Group Methods in Physics_ by Creswick, Farach and Poole. Variants of the argument appeared first in work by [Shapiro](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3719/11/13/028) and [Napiorkowski et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596017990001X) in the late 1970s.


## The Self Avoiding Walk
As discussed above, the self avoiding walk is a statistical mechanical model of a polymer chain. Allowed configurations of a chain composed of $$n$$ links are any configurations which do not contain self-intersections. There are many more configurations in which the chain is crumpled than straight: these therefore might hint that the end-to-end distance of the chain (in Euclidean space) scales sublinearly with $$n$$: we will say that $$|\vec R| \sim n^\nu$$ for some power $$\nu<1$$. It is known that if the chain were allowed to have self intersections, then it would just trace out a random walk, and we would have $$\nu=1/2$$. The question is what the effect of self avoidance is, and how it depends on the spatial dimension in which the chain is embedded.

## The generating function
In order to understand the behavior of the self avoiding walk, it will be useful to consider the partition function of the walk. Let us say that the beginning of the chain is at the origin, and the end is located at some position $$\vec R$$. Since all configurations which do not self-intersect have the same probability in the ensemble we are considering, and therefore the same energy, we can write the partition for a length-$$n$$ chain as

$$ M_n = \sum_{\vec R} M_n(\vec R)$$

where $$M_n(\vec R)$$ is the number of self avoiding walks of $$n$$ links which connect the origin to $$\vec R$$. They key step that will allow us to frame the self avoiding walk as a critical phenomenon and extract its properties using renormalization group methods is the introduction of a _grand canonical partition function_ in which we sum $$M_n$$ over $$n$$, with appropriate weighting that depends on $$n$$ via the exponential of a chemical potential that one can think of as a fugacity. In other words, we allow the number of links in the self avoiding walk to vary, and introduce a parameter $$K$$, which is like $$e^{\mu/T}$$ for temperature $$T$$ and chemical potential $$\mu$$, which controls the number of links in the chains that dominate the sum over $$n$$. Defining this grand canonical partition function 

$$ G(K) = \sum_{n} K^n M_n$$

will be important for the steps that follow.
